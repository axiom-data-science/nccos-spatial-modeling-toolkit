# ncos-spatial-modeling-toolkit
A set of tools and code snippets used to process data for spatial modeling. These were developed for use with two aquaculture suitability projects funded by the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS):

- Ocean Development Constraints: a project aiming to create a data layer that covers the US Exclusive Economic Zone but specifically excludes any areas that are unsuitable for aquaculture development.
- Alaska Spatial Data Development: a project aiming to create a more general aquaculture suitabibility map based on a variety of "best available" data layers.
